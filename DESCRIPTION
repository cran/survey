Title: Analysis of Complex Survey Samples
Description: Summary statistics, two-sample tests, rank tests, generalised linear models, cumulative link models, Cox models, loglinear models, and general maximum pseudolikelihood estimation for multistage stratified, cluster-sampled, unequally weighted survey samples. Variances by Taylor series linearisation or replicate weights. Post-stratification, calibration, and raking. Two-phase and multiphase subsampling designs. Graphics. PPS sampling without replacement. Small-area estimation. Dual-frame designs.
