Title: analysis of complex survey samples
Description: Summary statistics, two-sample tests, generalised linear
        models, cumulative link models, Cox models, loglinear models,
        and general maximum pseudolikelihood estimation for multistage
        stratified, cluster-sampled, unequally weighted survey samples.
        Variances by Taylor series linearisation or replicate weights.
        Post-stratification, calibration, and raking. Two-phase
        subsampling designs. Graphics. Predictive margins by direct
        standardization. PPS sampling without replacement. Principal
        components, factor analysis.
